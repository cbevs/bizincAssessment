What is the difference between `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` in Next.js?

--Using getStaticProps will make Next.js pre-render the page at build time using the props returned by getStaticProps. These props should not change, as they are static. If you build your project with getStaticProps which returns props from a .json file then change the data in the .json file, it will not show the new data, but only the data from the initial build. In my Next.js example, if I added { "name": "Moose Tracks", "rating": "4.2" } to my iceCreams.json after the project has been built, it will not display on the page. getServerSideProps renders the contents at the time of the request, meaning the data can change and the page will update on each request. If my project in the future allowed users to add their own ratings, I would switch from getStaticProps to getServerSideProps and this would allow the data displayed on my page to be dynamic and refreshed every time the page is requested.
