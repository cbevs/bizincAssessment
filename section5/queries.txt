- Create a table `users` with columns for `id`, `name`, and `email`.

CREATE TABLE users(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

// I chose to do a serial primary key so they auto increment, preventing manual input from causing errors when adding a user. If I was to create it without that, I would do 'id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY'. No person has the same email as another, so to keep data integrity, I added a unique attribute to email.

- Insert one sample user into the table.

INSERT INTO users(name, email) VALUES 
  ('Chris Bevevino', 'cnbevevino@gmail.com');

  // If there was not serial attribute on "id", it would include it like so:
  INSERT INTO users(id, name, email) VALUES 
  (1, 'Chris Bevevino', 'cnbevevino@gmail.com');


- Retrieve all users from the table.

SELECT * FROM users;
