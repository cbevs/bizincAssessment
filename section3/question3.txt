How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations, and why is this beneficial?

-- Node handles async operations by utilizing callbacks (functions passed as arguments to following functions), promises (Objects that can be chained that represent the eventual completion of the function), or async/await (a more readable version of promises). These operations allow other code to be run further down the file while the async code is being completed. It's like saying "hey, I'm going to reach out for this request, but let me know when I get a response. Until then I'll keep running the rest of my code." This is beneifcial because we now won't get stuck waiting while waiting for the data from the async code to be returned before continuing the rest of our code.
